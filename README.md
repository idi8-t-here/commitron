# commitron
->is a commit bot that picks a random file from your code base and commits random but syntatically and sematically valid sections of code.
Last but not least it utilizes code rabbits api to write code review for your code and also ... keep up with me, simulates pr interaction utilizing the gh terminal interface for PR managment in github.

->explicitly made with the purpose of aiding myself in finding a job, where I'm from they like to look at your github like that means anything

->Anyways if you'd like to contribute to this mad crusade of a git commit bot but over-engineered, feel free to fork and get back to me.
